      newspaper and has been translated into 23 languages, depicts human

        >sexual selection in human evolution</a
      >
      has caused humans to have the highest ratio of penis size to body mass.
      Morris conjectured that human
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear-lobes" class="mw-redirect" title="Ear-lobes"
        >ear-lobes</a
      >
      developed as an additional erogenous zone to facilitate the extended
      sexuality necessary in the evolution of human monogamous pair bonding.
      Morris further stated that the more rounded shape of human female
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast" title="Breast">breasts</a> means they are mainly a
      sexual signalling device rather than simply for providing milk for
      infants.<sup id="cite_ref-BBC_1-1" class="reference"

      Morris framed many features of human behaviour in the context of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolution</a> at a time when
      cultural explanations were more orthodox. For example, Morris wrote that
      the intense human pair bond evolved so that men who were out hunting could
      trust that their mates back home were not having sex with other men, and
      suggested the possibility that sparse body hair evolved because the
      "nakedness" helped intensify pair bonding by increasing tactile
      pleasure.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"
