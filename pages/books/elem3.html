      In <i>The Burnout Society</i> (original German title:
      <span style="padding-right: 0.1em"><i>Müdigkeitsgesellschaft</i></span
      >), Han characterizes today's society as a pathological landscape of
      neuronal disorders such as

      caused by the

      According to Han, driven by the demand to persevere and not to fail, as
      well as by the ambition of efficiency, we become committers and
      sacrificers at the same time and enter a swirl of demarcation,
      self-exploitation and collapse. "When production is immaterial, everyone
      already owns the means of production, him- or herself. The neoliberal
      system is no longer a class system in the proper sense. It does not
      consist of classes that display mutual antagonism. This is what accounts
      for the system's stability."<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"

      Han argues that subjects become self-exploiters: "Today, everyone is an
      <i>auto-exploiting labourer in his or her own enterprise.</i> People are
      now master and slave in one. Even class struggle has transformed into an
      <i>inner struggle against oneself</i>."<sup
        id="cite_ref-8"
        class="reference"
        ><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup
      >
      The individual has become what Han calls "the achievement-subject"; the
      individual does not believe they are subjugated "subjects" but rather
      "projects: Always refashioning and reinventing ourselves" which "amounts
      to a form of compulsion and constraint—indeed, to a "more efficient kind
      of subjectivation and subjugation." As a project deeming itself free of
      external and alien limitations, the "I" subjugates itself to internal
      limitations and self-constraints, which are taking the form of compulsive
      achievement and optimization.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"
